# AnimX Animation Library

This library provides a set of function to calculate animation curve values in the exact same way as Maya. 
The library's main goal is to replicate interpolation schemes found in Maya. While an interface is provided to Maya's animation curves, curve storage, serialization, etc. is delegated to the client code. A python-based test suite is included to demonstrate how to use the library and ease validation against Maya.

# This is an interface for the PureBasic programming Language
